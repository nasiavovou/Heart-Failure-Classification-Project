# Heart-Failure-Classification-Project
In this project, I will use a dataset from Kaggle to predict the survival of patients with heart failure. This is done using various factors, including serum creatinine, ejection fraction, age, anemia, diabetes, and more.  I will build a single-layer Sequential model to predict the mortality caused by heart failure.
